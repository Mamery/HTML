    <h1>What is Raya and the last dragon based on?</h1>
   
    <div>

        <blockquote>
            As has been mentioned, Raya and the Last Dragon takes inspiration heavily from Southeast Asian culture, with producer Osnat Shurer overseeing a group known as the Southeast Asia Story Trust filled with anthropologists, architects, dancers, linguists, and musicians.
